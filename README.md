# [Project 2: Neural Net for Prediction](https://github.com/nbapproved/neural-net-project)
* Created neural network that can classify objects between 2 different sets of pictures
* Pictures collected from Google Images
* Used about 3.7 million trainable parameters to train the model in about 60 seconds
* Achieved 100% accuracy (based on limited validation and testing data)
